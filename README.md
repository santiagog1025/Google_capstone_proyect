# Employee Retention Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze employee retention at Salifort Motors using various machine learning models. The primary goal is to predict employee turnover and provide data-driven recommendations to improve employee satisfaction and retention rates.

## Key Components

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- Initial data analysis and cleaning.
- Feature engineering and selection.

### Modeling
Several models were implemented and compared:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest

### Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**
- **Accuracy**
- **AUC-ROC**

### Feature Importance Analysis
- Identification of key factors influencing employee turnover.

## Key Findings
- The **Random Forest** model (rf1) outperformed other models across all metrics.
- Important features influencing employee turnover were identified, providing valuable insights for management.

## Business Recommendations
- Focus on addressing key factors contributing to employee turnover, such as compensation and job satisfaction.
- Develop targeted retention strategies based on model insights to minimize turnover rates.
- Implement data-driven decision-making processes within the organization to proactively address potential employee turnover.

## Future Improvements
- Further feature engineering to include additional relevant factors.
- Hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance.
- Regular updates to the models to reflect current trends and data patterns.

## Ethical Considerations
- Ensure data privacy and compliance with regulations to protect employee information.
- Mitigate potential biases in the models that may arise from imbalanced datasets.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced data visualization.
